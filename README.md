# Computational and Systems Biologist

### Technical Skills: C++, R, MATLAB, Python

### Biography

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, University of Wisconsin–Madison, working in the Roy Lab under the mentorship of Professor Sushmita Roy. My research focuses on the development and application of machine learning and network-based methods for analyzing single-cell and bulk multi-omics data, with particular emphasis on gene regulatory networks and evolutionary systems biology in both mammalian and plant systems.  <br>

I completed my Ph.D. in Systems Biology from the University of Calcutta, where I explored neurophysiopharmacological mechanisms of human brain networks in health and disease using integrative computational approaches. My doctoral work was supported by the DBT-BINC Fellowship (All-India Rank 17), awarded by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India.  <br>

Prior to that, I earned a Master’s degree in Pharmacoinformatics from NIPER Mohali, and a Bachelor’s in Pharmaceutical Technology from Jadavpur University. My research background combines bioinformatics, network biology, computational pharmacology, and artificial intelligence, aiming to bridge data-driven discoveries with translational relevance.  <br>

My work has been published in journals such as Scientific Reports and Life Sciences, with multiple presentations at international conferences in computational biology and neuroscience. I have received several honors, including best poster awards and recognition at symposia hosted by ISCB and the Wisconsin Stem Cell Symposium.  <br>

I am also an active scientific reviewer for journals and conferences, including IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, WIREs DMKD, and RECOMB, and I hold membership in the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB).  <br>

Beyond research, I am passionate about science communication, open-source development, and mentoring students in bioinformatics and systems biology.  <br>
